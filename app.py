mission.mhpwebserver.com -- backend for the launch & active-mission dashboard.

Serves one normalised JSON document assembled from Launch Library 2 (see
ll2.py), plus a caching image proxy. Visitors never touch the upstream API or
its CDN directly: the request budget is shared and finite, and proxying the
imagery keeps visitor IPs off a third-party host.

# Slim launch feed for other Slippy Labs sites (calendar.slippylabs.com).
#
# /api/data is ~250 KB and grows: it carries descriptions, imagery, stream
# lists and full provider statistics. A calendar needs a name and a date. This
# is the same data, reduced to what a date grid can actually draw, and it is
# built from the SAME cached payload -- it costs nothing against the shared
# 15-requests/hour upstream budget.
#
# CORS is open (`*`) on purpose and is safe here: the response is public,
# read-only, and carries no credentials or per-visitor state. It is set from
# Flask rather than nginx so it travels with the route through proxy_pass.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# LL2 publishes how precisely a T-0 is known. Anything coarser than the hour is
# an estimate that can move by days, and the dashboard labels those "Date
# unconfirmed" rather than drawing them as settled. A calendar has to make the
# same distinction or it will assert a launch time that nobody has committed
# to: confirmed launches get a clock, estimated ones get the whole day.
# These are LL2's own abbreviations, and they match the `exact: true` rows of
# the PRECISION table the dashboard front-end uses (www/assets/app.js) -- the
# two must agree, or the same launch would read as confirmed in one place and
# an estimate in the other. Note the feed also emits M, Q3, Q4 and friends,
# which correctly fall through as estimates.
